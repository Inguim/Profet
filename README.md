### üèçÔ∏è How it works
His operation is very simple and can be understood when opening the site: [Profet](https://profet.cefetvga.pro.br/), but making a brief summary: It serves as a showcase for the projects being developed at CEFET-MG, and these will be divided into categories, as well in two type of users: teacher and participants. Regardless of the type of user (they must have a validated account on the platform by a admin user), a project registration can be made, but the registration undergoes an approval  for definitive inclusion in the system. The same happens when a user tries to register in the system, however, registered or not, anyone can view the projects.
